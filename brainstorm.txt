Concept brainstorm time!

Theme-appropriate mechanics and concepts for "connected" :

- Connected / directed graphs
- Physical connections (chains/ropes/attracting forces, etc.)
- Non-physical connections (relationships, etc.)
- Rabbit holes, portals, etc.

Theme-appropriate mechanics and concepts for "worlds" :

- Universes (and alternate universes)
- Spheres  of awareness / mental models of the world

Drift!

Ocean setting - semi-Gargantia-esque. Control collections of rafts, boats, etc. coupled together in an ad-hoc fashion (ropes, chains, etc.)

Roles that individual component rafts can play:

- Propulsion
- Food production (farming - constant low food production)
- Food production (fishing - high food production when over regions with fish, until depleted)
- Combat (attack and subdue enemy rafts within range)
- Housing (ups max connection limit)
