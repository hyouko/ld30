< How to play: >
----------------

* Your goal is generally to wake up as many of the other drifting raft guys (-_-) as possible; lose too many and you will fail

* Keep your crew's health topped up by catching fish.

* Avoid the gunboats and mines - they are out to get you!  (You can defend yourself by grabbing gun-rafts, if you can find them).

* Specific levels may have additional goals...

< About the game: >
-------------------

This game and all of the game assets were created by Chris Drouin (cdrouin@alum.wpi.edu) in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 30 game compo.

It's based on an idea I had many years ago while working as a lifeguard out on the far docks at a summer camp.

Source code (and updated versions) are available here:
